abstract = {The thinking-process for playing chess by computer is significantly different from that used by humans. Also, computer hardware/software has evolved considerably in the half century since minimax was first, proposed as a method for computers to play chess. In this paper we look at the technology behind today's chess programs, how it has developed, its current, status, and explore some directions for the future.},
