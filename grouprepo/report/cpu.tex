For CPU implementations we explore two options: 1) serial, 2) OpenMP parallelized version. As explained in Section~\ref{sec:minimax}, finding the best move is fairly trivial once the minimax algorithm is well defined. Since we have a for loop that can parallelized, (i.e. no data dependency between the sub-trees etc.) the OpenMP implementation simply adds a \mintinline{C}{#pragma omp parallel for} on the for loop. Although it's simplicity is attractive, this strategy fails to take full advantage of alpha-beta bounds found in other sub-trees. This is a similar criticism that Borovska and Lazorova had as explained in Section~\ref{sec:relworks}.~\cite{borovska}.
