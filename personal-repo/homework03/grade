9.5/10
Good job on using the whisker plot to show statistical information.
However, your assertion that - if you pre-sort the rows, COO will work correctly without locks - is incorrect.
Any time that different threads update the same row, locks or synchronization is required for correctness, as you cannot make any assumptions about how the threads are scheduled and executed.
