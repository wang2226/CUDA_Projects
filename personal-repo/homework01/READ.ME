1) Implement the serial version of calculating Pi as described in the class lecture.
2) Implement the two parallel version using OpenMP - one using reduce and one using atomic add.
3) Experiment with your code to see how well it performs and how accurate of a result you can get with different number of threads and steps (slices).
4) Write up a small (one page) report outlining your findings (use Latex). Use Figures when possible.
